Abstract         
There is an amazing amount of diversity incorporated into the genome of oysters and other marine invertebrates including vastly expanded gene families, high mutation rates, and numerous mobile elements. These are certainly a benefit to broadcast spawners living in fluctuating environments. Recent work examining DNA methylation is revealing new insight into similar diversity at the epigenetic level. The function of DNA methylation in species such as bivalves where the limited amount of DNA methylation is predominantly found in gene bodies is not completely understood. One emerging possible explanation is that the role of gene body DNA methylation is dependent on gene function, a potential phenomenon that has arisen from selective pressure on lineage-specific life history traits. With respect to commercially important traits, we know that in other taxa epigenetic marks are associated with phenotypes independent of genetic variation, the environment can influence DNA methylation, and epigenetic marks can be inherited. In shellfish, we are still learning about role of epigenetic processes such as DNA methylation in controlling the phenome. However it does appear that epigenetic processes will be important to consider in future efforts to advance aquaculture, particularly in changing environments.

Bio    
Steven Roberts is the Kenneth K. Chew Endowed Professor in the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences at the University of Washington (Seattle, Washington, United States). Dr. Roberts received his Ph.D. in Biology at the University of Notre Dame (South Bend, Indiana, United States) in 2002. His main research interest is the physiological response of aquatic species to environmental change with a particular focus on environmental epigenetics, reproductive biology, and aquaculture. This includes examining functional aspects of DNA methylation in oysters, geoduck clams, and corals.
A large part of his lab's research acitivity includes analysis of large genomic datasets. In doing this, they practice open notebook science, strive to make all data analysis easily reproducible, and hold open online lab meetings.
